        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Cassandra Cortez and I live in Brooklyn, New York. I've lived here all my life with my mom and my older sister. I used to customize personal sites using CSS/HTML in the past, though I'm definitely NOT an expert and have forgotten so much over the years. I'm from Brooklyn, New York and I have two cats of 6 years that I love dearly.</p>

        <p>I'm currently watching a recently released anime called "DanDaDan", but my personal favorites would be the Evangelion series and Fooly Cooly. All my life I've been fascinated with art and design, 2D and 3D. Throughout my childhood and teenage years I've used programs such as Photoshop, MMD, Blender, Unity, and various art programs on both PC and mobile. Being a 2D digital artist, I try and take commissions whenever I can. However, I love designing and editing 3D models for VRChat even if I'm never active.</p>

        <p>My main goal is simply to graduate college with a bachelors and become a freelance artist. I've thought about streaming as well, though I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be in that field. I guess one of my future goals is to travel the world and try tons of different dishes with my partner. One place I've really wanted to visit is "Cat Island" in Ozu, Japan. It seems so nice and relaxing, plus there's cats everywhere! <3</p>
